WRMS
====

Wireless Ranked Media System

IDEA
----

Imagine a common situation: People sitting at a party, having fun, but the music
currently playing just does not have the drive you would like to experience right
now. The first solution that comes to mind is to play your own music, but it is
usually hard to reach consent, especially at huge parties. So one solution could
be a DJ-free ranking system usable by everyone. Welcome the **WRMS**.

WRMS consists of a player, which is controlled over dbus and features a weighted
playlist. The playlist implements a upvote/downvote system deciding the order
in which the queued songs are played.
And a simple and easy to use frontend to control the player.
