WRMS

Wireless Ranked Media System

IDEA
----

Imagine a common situation: People sitting at a party, having fun, but the music that is playing right
now just does not have the drive you would like do experience right now. The first solution that comes to mind is
to play your own music, but it is usually hard to reach consent, especially at huge parties. So why not a DJ-free
ranking system usable by everyone? That is exactly what we are looking to create, the WRMS.

We are trying to create a flawless experience for parties or just with friends by combining a convenient upvote/downvote-
system similiar to the one used on reddit, with a player that ranks queued songs via network according to the votes given
by the users. With this system, we are hopefully able to achieve a new way to enjoy music with any kind of company.
